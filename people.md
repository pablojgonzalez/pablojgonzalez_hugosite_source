### Current team members:
* [Pablo J. González](people/pablojgonzalez) (Senior Researcher)
* [Yu Jiang] (https://sites.google.com/view/yujiang/home) (COMET and University of Liverpool PhD researcher funded by CSC China Scholarship, 2017-2021). Yu works on the mechanics of continental normal faults applying satellite geodesy and bayesian inference methods.

In addition, we have enjoyed working with our lab [visitors](people/visitors), and [past team members](people/pastmembers).

### Work with us:
The Estación Volcanológica de Canarias is a research group within [CSIC](www.csic.es/en), Spain's largest research-intensive institution. CSIC is not an academic institution and does not award PhD degrees. However, we are able to supervise, e.g., early career researchers a) who are enrolled in Environmental and Earth Sciences PhD programs at Spanish universities, b) postdoctoral researchers (Marie Curie, Juan de la Cierva, etc), or c) otherwise self-funded researchers who want to spend time in Tenerife for a time-limited project. 

<!-- all the information on the programme and the requirements to enter are [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/research/postgraduate-opportunities/earth-and-ocean-sciences/earth-and-ocean-sciences-phd/overview/)

If you are already graduated from a MSc or BSc degree in some discipline in Earth Sciences, I can help you to fund your PhD studies using one of the following funding options:
1. Usually, I offer PhD projects for the Liverpool-Manchester Doctoral Training Programme. There are 12 competitive awards each year, although priority is given to British nationals every nationality is encouraged to [apply](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentships-earth-atmosphere-ocean/studentships/) 
2. A highly regarded option for any potential student open to any nationality is the [Duncan Normal Research Scholarship](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/student-administration/research-students/fees-and-funding/scholarships/duncan-norman-research-scholarship/). This Scholarship is highly competitive, therefore I encourage you to contact me as soon as possible to prepare a high quality application.
3. If you are a Chinese national, there is another independent route for you to come to work with us at Liverpool. [The University of Liverpool and China Scholarship Council Awards](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/finance/scholarships/china-scholarship/), is a fully funded scholarship that covers all your research and teaching fees with an allowance for a paid return trip to the UK  -->

If you are interested to collaborate, please [contact me](mailto:pabloj.gonzalez@csic.es) and come to research in Tenerife.
