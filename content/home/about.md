# Biography
Pablo J. González is a Senior Researcher in Geodynamics and Structure of the Lithosphere, at the [Estación Volcanológica de Canarias](https://www.ipna.csic.es/en/research-lines/volcanology) (IPNA-CSIC) located in La Laguna, Tenerife, Canary Islands.

We study volcano and fault mechanics, or in simple terms, how and why volcanoes and faults deform. A knowledge with practical application for geological hazard assessment, and risk reduction. To learn more about magmatic sytems and fault zone processes we use constrains from geophysical and geodetic observations, mainly Earth Observation data. Our ultimate goal is to gain insights into the physical behaviour of volcanoes and fault systems to incorporate into models with ever increasing predictive power.

# Research interests
* Magma storage and migration at volcanoes
* Fault dynamics and kinematics, including volcano-tectonics
* Fluid-rock mechanical interactions (Induced seismicity, groundwater changes)
* Geodetic and geophysical techniques: data processing and analysis
* Geophysical inverse problems (Bayesian inference)
* Machine Learning (Reduce Order Models and Deep Learning)
