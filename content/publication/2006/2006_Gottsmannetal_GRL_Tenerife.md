abstract = "Geophysical signals accompanying the reactivation of a volcano after a period of quiescence must be evaluated as potential precursors to impending eruption. Here we report on the reactivation of the central volcanic complex of Tenerife, Spain, in spring 2004 and present gravity change maps constructed by time‐lapse microgravity measurements taken between May 2004 and July 2005. The gravity changes indicate that the recent reactivation after almost a century of inactivity was accompanied by a sub‐surface mass addition, yet we did not detect widespread surface deformation. We find that the causative source was evolving in space and time and infer fluid migration at depth as the most likely cause for mass increase. Our results demonstrate that, even in the absence of previous baseline data and ground deformation, microgravity measurements early in developing crises provide crucial insight into the dynamic changes beneath a volcano."
