## Work with us

The University of Liverpool with the Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences has a prestigious PhD program in Earth Sciences, all the information on the programme and the requirements to enter are [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/research/postgraduate-opportunities/earth-and-ocean-sciences/earth-and-ocean-sciences-phd/overview/)

If you are already graduated from a MSc or BSc degree in some discipline in Earth Sciences, I can help you to fund your PhD studies using one of the following funding options:
1. Usually, I offer PhD projects for the Liverpool-Manchester Doctoral Training Programme. There are 12 competitive awards each year, although priority is given to British nationals every nationality is encouraged to [apply](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/studentships-earth-atmosphere-ocean/studentships/) 
2. A highly regarded option for any potential student open to any nationality is the [Duncan Normal Research Scholarship](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/student-administration/research-students/fees-and-funding/scholarships/duncan-norman-research-scholarship/). This Scholarship is highly competitive, therefore I encourage you to contact me as soon as possible to prepare a high quality application.
3. If you are a Chinese national, there is another independent route for you to come to work with us at Liverpool. [The University of Liverpool and China Scholarship Council Awards](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/finance/scholarships/china-scholarship/), is a fully funded scholarship that covers all your research and teaching fees with an allowance for a paid return trip to the UK 

In additional, to those routes there could be other opportunities based on specific successful research grants. Therefore, I will also encourage to [contact me](mailto:pjgonzal@liverpool.ac.uk) for an update on other possible posts in my group.
