I grew up in Tenerife loving seawater and mountain views.

At some point, I was told that Teide was a volcano. Few solar revolutions later, a high-school geology teacher inspired me to spend more time looking at rocks. So I did, and at 18, I left Tenerife to Granada and I met more inspiring teachers. There, they call them, professors (thanks Juan Ignacio Soto and Jose Morales). Before graduate, I had a great summer at a Mexican volcano and a full year in Germany (thanks Janet). There, a wise old German man showed me to download wiggles caused by far-away ruptures (thanks Rainer Kind). I ignored much about how big a deal were GFZ Potsdam and its on-line library, but it allowed me to discover some intriguing and hypnotic multicolour images from Iceland. Back in Spain, GPS became my first paid job, but laud bosses darken my soul. I chose to go alone and watched multicolour images to cheer me up. I escaped to Canada, met good friends and had bad times. Back to Europe, I had more bad times, but it was improving. I was improving. One day, someone told me that what I do was really good at the right time. So I must always thank him to allow me call Liverpool home. 20 years passed since I left the seawater and mountain views. I was happier than ever, and I thought that I could even be bold. So, thanks to everyone on the road…

Since 2019, I am a volcanologist who enjoys seawater and mountain views.
